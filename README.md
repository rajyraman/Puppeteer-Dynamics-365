# Puppeteer - Dynamics 365

Sample project that illustrates the use of Puppeteer with Dynamics CRM/365. Puppeteer is still in alpha (v0.10.2), and so this repo is intended as a proof of concept.

This application takes screenshots of selected subgroups, forms and annotates the screenshot using imagemagick. The idea is to use this as a documentation assistance.
